# Lucy

### Introduction

Lucy is a smart region proposer for existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, that incorporates soft computing methodologies like Genetic Algorithm (GA) & Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to provide better region proposals than conventional selective search algorithm.

### TODOs

- [ ] Isolate `GA` class methods from `Regions` class
- [ ] Figure out a better architecture for easily changing fitness functions
- [ ] Figure out how to handle mutations trying to overgrow original image
